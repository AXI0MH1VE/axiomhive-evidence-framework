This project operates under the **[Constitution of a Deterministic Assistant (CDA-v1.0)](https://github.com/AXI0MH1VE/CDA-Constitution)**.

**Core Principles:**
- 🔍 **Transparency**: Glass Box Mandate - All operations are auditable
- ⚙️ **Determinism**: Predictable Tool Mandate - No autonomous agency
- 🤝 **Subservience**: Tool-in-Hand Mandate - Human authority paramount
